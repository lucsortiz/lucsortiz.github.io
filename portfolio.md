## Websites

- **[hotelbrena.com](http://www.hotelbrena.com)** - Showcase website for a popular hotel with gourmet restaurant located in a natural reserve

- Whole concept idea and design of the fully responsive website 
- Full 3-breakpoints responsive design / coding / integration with Wordpress CMS

- **[MakeupBee.com](https://www.makeupbee.com)** - website for women to discover and talk about interesting makeup applications. Clearly my area of expertise! The site was mostly developed by Brent Francia (CEO) and I, and I was responsible for all aspects of the development, seeing as we were usually a 2-3 person team.

- **[Glittr.com](https://www.glittr.com)** - spin-off of MakeupBee that was designed to be more focused on mainstream looks and have a cleaner feel. I've written most of the code for this site.

- **[Jauntr.com](http://www.jauntr.com/)** - travel site with a social component, that is meant to help users discover and share places to go. It never really took off, but it was my first introduction to web development.

- **[daattali.com](http://daattali.com)** - small personal website that I run on a virtual server just because I wanted a place to host my own [R Shiny server](http://daattali.com/shiny) and [RStudio server](http://daattali.com/rstudio).

- **[deanattali.com](http://deanattali.com)** - the site you're currently on.  Just a simple site to have some virtual presence.
